\title{Generic Spatial Early-Warnings}
\usage{
\method{indictest}{generic_spews_single}(obj, null_replicates = 999, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{A \code{generic_spews} object as produced by 
\code{\link{generic_spews}}.}

\item{null_replicates}{The number of replicates to use to compute a null 
distribution}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{generic_spews_test} (actually, a 
  data.frame).
}
\description{
Assessment of the significance of generic early-warning signals
  values
}
\details{
The significance of generic early-warning signals can be estimated by 
  reshuffling the original matrix randomly. Indicators are then recomputed 
  on the shuffled matrices and the values obtained are used as a null 
  distribution. P-values are obtained based on the rank of the observered
  value in the null distribution.

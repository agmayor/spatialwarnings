\title{Generic spatial warning signals}
\usage{
generic_spews(mat, subsize = 4, detrend = FALSE,
  moranI_coarse_grain = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{mat}{A matrix (quantitative data), a binary matrix (qualitative data), 
or a list of those}

\item{subsize}{The subsize used for the coarse-graining phase (see Details)}

\item{detrend}{Should the values be detrended by removing the spatial mean
of the matrix ?}

\item{moranI_coarse_grain}{Should the input matrix be coarse-grained before
computing the Moran's I indicator value ?}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{generic_spews_single} (actually a list) 
  if mat is a single matrix or an object of class \code{generic_spews_list} 
  if mat is list.
}
\description{
Computation of spatial generic early warning signals (Moran's I,
  variance and skewness)
}
\details{
The Generic Early warning signal are based on the property of a 
  dynamical system to "slow down" when approaching a critical point, 
  that is take more time to return to equilibrium after a perturbation. This 
  is expected to be reflected in several spatial characteristics: the 
  variance, the spatial autocorrelation (at lag-1) and the skewness. This 
  function provides a convenient workflow to compute these indicators, 
  assess their significance and display the results. 

Before computing the actual indicators, the matrix can be "coarse-grained". 
  This process reduces the matrix by averaging the nearby cells using 
  a square window defined by the \code{subsize} parameter. This helps 
  removing artefactual trends in variance and skewness due to binary (1/0) 
  data.
